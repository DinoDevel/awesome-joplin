## Tools

- [Web Clipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/). A browser extension that allows
  you to save web pages and screenshots from your browser. To start using it,
  open the Joplin desktop application, go to the Web Clipper Options and follow
  the instructions.
- [File Uploader and OCR (a.k.a. REST
  Uploader)](https://github.com/kellerjustin/rest-uploader). Command line
  companion application to supplement Joplin. The app monitors a directory you
  specify; when new files are created in the directory, it automatically uploads
  the file as text or an attachment (depending on file type) to a new note in
  Joplin. The app performs OCR on images and PDFs, and the text is dropped into
  the note as a comment. An image preview is also created for PDFs.
- [Python Joplin API](https://github.com/foxmask/joplin-api). The API of Joplin
  Editor in Python 3.6+.
- [Yeoboseyo](https://github.com/foxmask/yeoboseyo). "The bus for your internet
  services." A companion for Joplin which allows creating notes from RSS Feeds,
  plus others possibilities, like publishing the same RSS Feeds on another
  service, like Mastodon.
